# Learning Technical Writing
This is a new repository for that I've created with the purpose of storing and sharing technical writing documents during my technical writing journey. As a technical business analyst and I am working on transitioning into technical writing.

## Introductory Technical Writing Course on Udemy
Learning from Jordan Stanchev on Udemy about Technical Writing: How to Write Software Documentation. According to Stanchev, "Technical writing is the basis for developing a holistic set of user assistance which includes written text, visual content, video, and multimedia content as well as strategies for delivering helpful guidance and assistance for the user. When developing your content using the principles of technical writing you create content that is clearly and consistently structured and organized. The way to structure and organize the content is predefined and follows organization-specific rules."
